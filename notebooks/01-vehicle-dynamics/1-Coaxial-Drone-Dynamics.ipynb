    "## Co-axial drone dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Drone1.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will populate the ```CoaxialCopter``` class with three methods. These functions will calculate vertical acceleration $\\ddot{z}$, angular acceleration $\\ddot{\\psi}$ along the $z$ axis and the angular velocities $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ of the propellers required to achieve any desired  $\\ddot{z}$ and $\\ddot{\\psi}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that drone only can travel and rotate along the vertical $z$ axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the positive $z$ axis points **downwards**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that the first propeller rotates clockwise, while the second propeller rotates counterclockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder**: The second propeller rotates counterclockwise thus the angular velocity needs to be positive, while angular velocity of the first propeller needs to be negative as it rotates clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $z$ axis points down (that is, become more positive).\n",
    "2. Top propeller is Propeller 1:\n",
    "   1. Rotates _clockwise_ (CW).\n",
    "   2. Its angular velocity $\\omega_1$ is **negative**.\n",
    "   3. (ivogeorg) By Note 1 below, the direction of the vector of the **torque** $W_1$ generated by a clockwise-rotating propeller is **positive**. It points **down**, in the positive $z$ direction. This actually IS the right-hand rule! \n",
    "3. Bottom propeller is Propeller 2:\n",
    "   1. Rotates _counterclockwise_ (CCW).\n",
    "   2. Its angular velocity $\\omega_2$ is **positive**.\n",
    "   3. (ivogeorg) By Note 1 below, the direction of the vector of the **torque** $W_2$ generated by a counterclockwise-rotating propeller is **negative**. It points **up**, in the negative $z$ direction. This IS the right-hand rule!)_\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Note 1:** The _right-hand rule_ for the positive $\\psi$ angles is the opposite to this convention. In the nadir perspective on the down-pointing $z$ axis, CW rotation defines positive angles. In the figure, the Propeller 1 spin direction is CW, **but** $\\omega_1$ is assumed to be negative. This propeller will induce a CCW rotation of the drone frame (i.e. the \"car\"), which will be defining negative $\\psi$ angles. In this case, the convention is in line with the direction of the torque of the rotating propeller which is exerted on the frame/body of the drone. So, this convention will give correct results in torque calculations with the $z$ axis pointing down (which is a convention for aerial vehicles). \n",
    "\n",
    "_(ivogeorg) Absolutely dismal wording:_ \n",
    "1. WTF is \"the rhr for positive psi angles\"? By the supposedly correct calculations in the test code, the rhr for ccw rotation points the torque up, so it is negative by the convention of down being positive in the $z$ dimension. Similarly, the rhr for cw rotation points the torque down, so it is positive.   \n",
    "2. WTF is \"the nadir perspective\"? Is it looking from the top down or from the bottom up?   \n",
    "3. $\\omega$-s being negative or positive does not affect the angular acceleration or torque calculations, because both $\\omega$-s are squared! It only matters when returning the calculated $\\omega$-s for certain target linear $\\ddot{z}$ and angular $\\ddot{\\psi}$ accelerations.     \n",
    "_Absolutely fucking appalling and very typical of Udacity materials! (ivogeorg-end)_\n",

    "_(ivogeorg) Some information from GPT in the context of this exercise_\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. On axes\n",
    "In the context of the Coaxial Drone Dynamics Exercise, the terms \"forward\" and \"right\" refer to the directions in which the drone is oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that the x-axis points forward, we mean that it points in the direction that the drone is facing. Similarly, when we say that the y-axis points to the right, we mean that it points in the direction perpendicular to the forward direction, towards the drone's right side. Finally, when we say that the z-axis points downward, we mean that it points in the direction opposite to the drone's upward direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that these conventions are arbitrary and can vary depending on the application. However, in the context of the Coaxial Drone Dynamics Exercise, these conventions are used consistently throughout the notebook to describe the orientation and motion of the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. On rotational angles and rates\n",
    "**Roll angle:** A positive roll angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the x-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. A negative roll angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the x-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitch angle:** A positive pitch angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the y-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from the right side of the drone. A negative pitch angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the y-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the right side of the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yaw angle:** A positive yaw angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the z-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. A negative yaw angle corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the z-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Roll rate:** A positive roll rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the x-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. A negative roll rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the x-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pitch rate:** A positive pitch rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the y-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from the right side of the drone. A negative pitch rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the y-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from the right side of the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yaw rate:** A positive yaw rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the z-axis in the clockwise direction when viewed from above. A negative yaw rate corresponds to a rotation of the drone around the z-axis in the counterclockwise direction when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. On the right-hand rule\n",
    "The right-hand rule is a convention used to determine the direction of rotation of a vector in three-dimensional space. In the context of the Coaxial Drone Dynamics Exercise, the right-hand rule for positive psi angles is used to determine the direction of the yaw angle (psi) when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the right-hand rule, you can point your right thumb in the direction of the positive z-axis (downward direction) and your fingers in the direction of the positive y-axis (right direction). Then, the direction of your curled fingers corresponds to the positive direction of the yaw angle (psi) when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the note in the Coaxial Drone Dynamics Exercise, it's important to note that the convention for the direction of rotation of the rotors and the sign of the angular velocities is arbitrary and can vary depending on the application. In the notebook, Propeller 1 is assumed to rotate clockwise and its angular velocity omega 1 is negative, while Propeller 2 is assumed to rotate counterclockwise and its angular velocity omega 2 is positive. However, the right-hand rule convention for positive psi angles assumes the opposite convention, where Propeller 1 is assumed to rotate counterclockwise and its angular velocity omega 1 is positive, while Propeller 2 is assumed to rotate clockwise and its angular velocity omega 2 is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that both conventions are valid and can be used interchangeably, as long as they are used consistently throughout the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. On torque\n",
    "#### 1. Definition\n",
    "Torque is a measure of the force that causes an object to rotate around an axis or pivot point. Mathematically, torque is defined as the cross product of the force vector and the position vector, where the position vector is the vector from the pivot point to the point where the force is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a drone, the rotors generate a force that causes the drone to rotate around its center of mass. This force generates a torque that causes the drone to rotate around its center of mass. The magnitude of the torque is proportional to the magnitude of the force and the distance between the force and the center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a rotor is not attached to anything and is just spinning on its own, there is still a notion of torque. This is because the rotor is generating a force that is causing it to rotate around its own axis. The magnitude of the torque is proportional to the magnitude of the force and the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the context of a drone, the torque produced by the rotors is what causes the drone to rotate around its center of mass. This is because the rotors are attached to the drone and the force generated by the rotors is applied at a distance from the center of mass, which generates a torque that causes the drone to rotate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Direction\n",
    "Under the convention in the notebook for positive and negative angular velocities, and assuming that the directions of rotation of the rotors are such that they generate upward thrust, a positive torque on the drone would cause it to rotate counterclockwise when viewed from above, while a negative torque would cause it to rotate clockwise when viewed from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the direction of the torque on the drone is perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the rotors, and it is determined by the right-hand rule. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation of the rotor, then your thumb will point in the direction of the torque on the drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the rotors are generating upward thrust, the torque produced by the rotors is in the opposite direction to the rotation of the rotors. This means that if the rotors are rotating counterclockwise when viewed from above, then the torque produced by the rotors is clockwise when viewed from above, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Zero torque (rotational balance)\n",
    "If the drone is not rotating, then the net torque acting on the drone must be zero. This is because the drone is in rotational equilibrium, which means that the sum of all torques acting on the drone is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the drone is not rotating, then the torques produced by the rotors must be balanced by other torques acting on the drone, such as torques produced by the drone's weight or aerodynamic forces. This ensures that the drone remains in a stable, non-rotating state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that even if the drone is not rotating, the rotors are still producing a torque. However, this torque is being balanced by other torques acting on the drone, resulting in a net torque of zero.\n",
