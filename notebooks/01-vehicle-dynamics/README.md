# FCND Part 3: Controls (CPP)

## Section 1: Vehicle Dynamics

**Note:** The notebooks are in the order of the exercises from the section. The first link is the original exercise, possibly with my solution. The second link is the official solution.


1. [Coaxial Drone Dynamics](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/1-Coaxial-Drone-Dynamics.ipynb). ([solution](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/1-Coaxial-Drone-Dynamics-SOLUTION.ipynb))  
2. [Tracking Changes to State (RECORDING)](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/1.5-Tracking-Changes-to-State-RECORDING.ipynb).
3. [Advance State for Controlled Drone (Propellers Rotating)](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/2-Advance-State-for-Controlled-Drone.ipynb). ([solution](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/2-Advance-State-for-Controlled-Drone-SOLUTION.ipynb))
4. [Advance State for Controlled Drone (Propellers Rotating) With State Vectors](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/2-Advance-State-for-Controlled-Drone-with-State-Vectors.ipynb). 
5. [Uncontrolled Drone](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/3-Uncontrolled-2D-Drone.ipynb). ([solution](/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/3-Uncontrolled-2D-Drone-SOLUTION.ipynb))
6. [Calculating Accellerations in 2D](https://github.com/ivogeorg/FCND-Controls-CPP/blob/main/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/4-Calculating-Accelerations-in-2D.ipynb). ([solution](https://github.com/ivogeorg/FCND-Controls-CPP/blob/main/notebooks/01-vehicle-dynamics/4-Calculating-Accelerations-in-2D-SOLUTION.ipynb))  
7. [Controlling a 2D Drone]().

**TODO:** Organize 2-5 as well as the alternative material which adopts a different convention on rotational angles and also has some more detail on the process
