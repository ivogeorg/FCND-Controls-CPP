# FCND Part 3: Controls (CPP)

## Section 4: Full 3D Control

**Note:** The notebooks are in the order of the exercises from the section. The first link is the original exercise, possibly with my solution. The second link is the official solution, if provided as a notebook. In this section, the solution is provided as two classes in [solution.py](solution.py). The exercises provide a step-by-step implmentation path, with each exercise starting out with a call to the solution and requiring this call to be substituted with an original implementation.
